Google Translate Alfred Workflow
=============================

### Attention!

This version 2 is a complete rewrite! It works differentley than before while keeping the basic functionality, it is not longer bound to english and german. It know let Google decide which language is the source and you can define what the target language is in your query.

A workflow for Alfred 2 that implements translation from any language to any other language known to Google.

It's based on PHP and not very complex to understand.

## How to install
Just download and double click the [workflow file](https://github.com/thomashempel/AlfredGoogleTranslateWorkflow/raw/master/GoogleTranslate.alfredworkflow)
Say "yes" to import it into Alfred. Done!

## How to use
Open Alfred and type "translate" followed by the shortcode for the target language like "en" (english), "de" (german) or "it" (italian). You can find a complete list in the next section.

Alfred will show all the results that Google returned. Select the one that fits your situation best and the translated phrase will be copied to the clipboard.
